                    <p>National Chiao Tung University traces its origins back to "Nanyang Public School," founded in 1896 with the approval of Sheng Xuanhuai (1844-1916), a Qing official advocating for reform, who established the school in Shanghai. This marked the beginning of the Shanghai school, focusing on subjects related to shipping, postal services, and commerce. In 1920, under the leadership of the Minister of Transport, Ye Gongchuo (1881-1968), multiple schools under the Ministry were merged to form Chiao Tung University, solidifying its expertise in engineering, science, and management. In 1937, the university, along with others across the nation, came under the Ministry of Education and was renamed "National Chiao Tung University.</p>
                    <p>After a century of development in Taiwan, Chiao Tung University transitioned from a purely engineering institution to a comprehensive university. Before its merger with Yang Ming University in 2021, it housed a total of 12 colleges, including Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Science, Engineering, Management, Humanities, Life Sciences, Hakka Studies, Optoelectronics, Technology Law, International Semiconductor Industry, and Smart Science and Green Energy, with a student population reaching 13,000.</p>
                    <p>Yang Ming Chiao Tung University was established in 2021 through the merger of Yang Ming University and Chiao Tung University. Previously, both universities excelled in their respective fields of biomedicine and electrical engineering; the merger has created a complementary relationship. The newly formed Yang Ming Chiao Tung University comprises 9 campuses and 20 colleges, with nearly 20,000 students, making it one of Taiwan's largest research universities. With mutual agreement, the university aims to integrate biomedicine, electrical engineering, and artificial intelligence, focusing on advancing digital biomedical research and education, striving to lead in the revolution of smart biomedical technology.
