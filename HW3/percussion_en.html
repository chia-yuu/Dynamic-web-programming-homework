                    <h2>From Strangers to Familiar</h2>
                    <p>While most people learn instruments like piano or violin, I’m different—I learned percussion. My mom said she initially just wanted me to make new friends and interact more, but that interaction turned into a journey that lasted from age five to eighteen. The more I learned, the more I loved it, and I just kept going. Some people might dislike practicing, finding it tiring and boring, but I truly enjoy it and never feel it's tedious. Whenever I'm feeling down or stressed, I love to practice, whether it’s the pieces we cover in class, songs I find on my own, or melodies I hear that inspire me to write my own arrangements. As long as I’m standing in front of the xylophone with the mallets in hand, I can forget all my worries. I remind myself to take half an hour or an hour for myself—no matter what’s bothering me, I just focus on enjoying the music. In that moment, as I strike the bars, my wrists guide the mallets, and my body moves with the rhythm. I get carried away by the notes and escape from the troubles of reality, following the melody to a place of joy.</p>

                    <h2>The Happiest Class</h2>
                    <p>When I was younger and just starting out, I could only play simple pieces. But as I got older, the difficulty of the music increased, and every time I finished a piece, I felt such a sense of accomplishment—especially during ensemble performances. Each person has their own part, but when we come together, it sounds so beautiful. Beyond the music itself, I really enjoy the atmosphere in class. We all focus on the same goal, and during breaks, we chat and joke around. We even bargain with the teacher: “This piece is too hard! I can’t practice it!” or “This section is really tricky!”—even though we’ve probably already practiced it and just want to vent a little. The most exciting part of each class is when we receive new pieces. I always look forward to the thrill of having something new to practice. I wonder if it’ll be a piece I’ve heard before or one the teacher hinted at previously. Will I get to play the instrument I want? Every Monday, the day of class, I’m in a great mood all day, eagerly anticipating the evening lesson!</p>

                    <h2>Annual Concert</h2>
                    <p>The most important event of the year is the annual concert, where we are the stars of the show, given the opportunity to stand on stage and showcase our talents. From being a nervous freshman at the beginning to becoming an experienced performer who knows the entire process inside out, I’ve learned to truly enjoy the stage and make the most of every moment up there. After all, we prepared for so long just for this moment.</p>
                    <p>2022 was my graduation year, and it was also my final concert. At first, it felt like a disaster because our group, being older, had our rehearsal scheduled later. We ended up getting pushed back by the groups before us, and by the time it was our turn, we had only five minutes left. We could only go on stage to check our instruments and then leave—there was barely time to play anything. This venue was new to us, and since we hadn’t rehearsed, it felt incredibly daunting, especially with only twenty minutes until the audience arrived. Everyone was super nervous, and the pressure was immense. We could only practice our rhythms in the back, recalling the tricky spots we’d encountered in previous rehearsals and reminding ourselves to focus.</p>
                    <p>We were the second-to-last group in the second half of the concert. Before going on stage, we encouraged each other, saying to treat it like any other practice session and not to overthink it. We wanted to enjoy this last performance before graduation. Once we were on stage, I wasn’t as nervous as I expected, since it wasn’t my first time performing. As I watched the conductor’s hands come down, we all struck our mallets together, and the familiar melody filled the air. In that moment, I seemed to forget about the audience and everything else around me, completely immersed in the music, enjoying it alongside my fellow performers. When I finally came back to reality, we had already finished, and the audience erupted in enthusiastic applause. Still catching my breath, my arms slightly sore from my engagement in the performance, I looked out at the audience and wished time could freeze at that moment. I longed to continue playing and collaborating with everyone—graduation felt bittersweet.</p>
                    <p>Then I heard the host’s voice: "Graduating student Chia-Yu Wu, let’s wave to her!" That brought me back to reality. I smiled brightly and waved to the audience, just like the seniors I admired in years past. As a child sitting in the audience, I had watched those older students play so skillfully, wishing I could be like them. Now, I had become the big sister they looked up to, standing on stage and waving as a graduate. Perhaps there was a little girl in the audience looking at me, silently vowing to become someone like me one day.</p>
                    <p>Below is a video from the concert before my graduation, which I consider my most satisfying performance!</p>
